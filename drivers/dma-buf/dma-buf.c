/**
 * DOC: dma buf device access
 *
 * For device DMA access to a shared DMA buffer the usual sequence of operations
 * is fairly simple:
 *
 * 1. The exporter defines his exporter instance using
 *    DEFINE_DMA_BUF_EXPORT_INFO() and calls dma_buf_export() to wrap a private
 *    buffer object into a &dma_buf. It then exports that &dma_buf to userspace
 *    as a file descriptor by calling dma_buf_fd().
 *
 * 2. Userspace passes this file-descriptors to all drivers it wants this buffer
 *    to share with: First the filedescriptor is converted to a &dma_buf using
 *    dma_buf_get(). Then the buffer is attached to the device using
 *    dma_buf_attach().
 *
 *    Up to this stage the exporter is still free to migrate or reallocate the
 *    backing storage.
 *
 * 3. Once the buffer is attached to all devices userspace can initiate DMA
 *    access to the shared buffer. In the kernel this is done by calling
 *    dma_buf_map_attachment() and dma_buf_unmap_attachment().
 *
 * 4. Once a driver is done with a shared buffer it needs to call
 *    dma_buf_detach() (after cleaning up any mappings) and then release the
 *    reference acquired with dma_buf_get by calling dma_buf_put().
 *
 * For the detailed semantics exporters are expected to implement see
 * &dma_buf_ops.

/**
 * DOC: cpu access
 *
 * There are mutliple reasons for supporting CPU access to a dma buffer object:
 *
 * - Fallback operations in the kernel, for example when a device is connected
 *   over USB and the kernel needs to shuffle the data around first before
 *   sending it away. Cache coherency is handled by braketing any transactions
 *   with calls to dma_buf_begin_cpu_access() and dma_buf_end_cpu_access()
 *   access.
 *
 *   To support dma_buf objects residing in highmem cpu access is page-based
 *   using an api similar to kmap. Accessing a dma_buf is done in aligned chunks
 *   of PAGE_SIZE size. Before accessing a chunk it needs to be mapped, which
 *   returns a pointer in kernel virtual address space. Afterwards the chunk
 *   needs to be unmapped again. There is no limit on how often a given chunk
 *   can be mapped and unmapped, i.e. the importer does not need to call
 *   begin_cpu_access again before mapping the same chunk again.
 *
 *   Interfaces::
 *      void \*dma_buf_kmap(struct dma_buf \*, unsigned long);
 *      void dma_buf_kunmap(struct dma_buf \*, unsigned long, void \*);
 *
 *   There are also atomic variants of these interfaces. Like for kmap they
 *   facilitate non-blocking fast-paths. Neither the importer nor the exporter
 *   (in the callback) is allowed to block when using these.
 *
 *   Interfaces::
 *      void \*dma_buf_kmap_atomic(struct dma_buf \*, unsigned long);
 *      void dma_buf_kunmap_atomic(struct dma_buf \*, unsigned long, void \*);
 *
 *   For importers all the restrictions of using kmap apply, like the limited
 *   supply of kmap_atomic slots. Hence an importer shall only hold onto at
 *   max 2 atomic dma_buf kmaps at the same time (in any given process context).
 *
 *   dma_buf kmap calls outside of the range specified in begin_cpu_access are
 *   undefined. If the range is not PAGE_SIZE aligned, kmap needs to succeed on
 *   the partial chunks at the beginning and end but may return stale or bogus
 *   data outside of the range (in these partial chunks).
 *
 *   Note that these calls need to always succeed. The exporter needs to
 *   complete any preparations that might fail in begin_cpu_access.
 *
 *   For some cases the overhead of kmap can be too high, a vmap interface
 *   is introduced. This interface should be used very carefully, as vmalloc
 *   space is a limited resources on many architectures.
 *
 *   Interfaces::
 *      void \*dma_buf_vmap(struct dma_buf \*dmabuf)
 *      void dma_buf_vunmap(struct dma_buf \*dmabuf, void \*vaddr)
 *
 *   The vmap call can fail if there is no vmap support in the exporter, or if
 *   it runs out of vmalloc space. Fallback to kmap should be implemented. Note
 *   that the dma-buf layer keeps a reference count for all vmap access and
 *   calls down into the exporter's vmap function only when no vmapping exists,
 *   and only unmaps it once. Protection against concurrent vmap/vunmap calls is
 *   provided by taking the dma_buf->lock mutex.
 *
 * - For full compatibility on the importer side with existing userspace
 *   interfaces, which might already support mmap'ing buffers. This is needed in
 *   many processing pipelines (e.g. feeding a software rendered image into a
 *   hardware pipeline, thumbnail creation, snapshots, ...). Also, Android's ION
 *   framework already supported this and for DMA buffer file descriptors to
 *   replace ION buffers mmap support was needed.
 *
 *   There is no special interfaces, userspace simply calls mmap on the dma-buf
 *   fd. But like for CPU access there's a need to braket the actual access,
 *   which is handled by the ioctl (DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC). Note that
 *   DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC can fail with -EAGAIN or -EINTR, in which case it must
 *   be restarted.
 *
 *   Some systems might need some sort of cache coherency management e.g. when
 *   CPU and GPU domains are being accessed through dma-buf at the same time.
 *   To circumvent this problem there are begin/end coherency markers, that
 *   forward directly to existing dma-buf device drivers vfunc hooks. Userspace
 *   can make use of those markers through the DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC ioctl. The
 *   sequence would be used like following:
 *
 *     - mmap dma-buf fd
 *     - for each drawing/upload cycle in CPU 1. SYNC_START ioctl, 2. read/write
 *       to mmap area 3. SYNC_END ioctl. This can be repeated as often as you
 *       want (with the new data being consumed by say the GPU or the scanout
 *       device)
 *     - munmap once you don't need the buffer any more
 *
 *    For correctness and optimal performance, it is always required to use
 *    SYNC_START and SYNC_END before and after, respectively, when accessing the
 *    mapped address. Userspace cannot rely on coherent access, even when there
 *    are systems where it just works without calling these ioctls.
 *
 * - And as a CPU fallback in userspace processing pipelines.
 *
 *   Similar to the motivation for kernel cpu access it is again important that
 *   the userspace code of a given importing subsystem can use the same
 *   interfaces with a imported dma-buf buffer object as with a native buffer
 *   object. This is especially important for drm where the userspace part of
 *   contemporary OpenGL, X, and other drivers is huge, and reworking them to
 *   use a different way to mmap a buffer rather invasive.
 *
 *   The assumption in the current dma-buf interfaces is that redirecting the
 *   initial mmap is all that's needed. A survey of some of the existing
 *   subsystems shows that no driver seems to do any nefarious thing like
 *   syncing up with outstanding asynchronous processing on the device or
 *   allocating special resources at fault time. So hopefully this is good
 *   enough, since adding interfaces to intercept pagefaults and allow pte
 *   shootdowns would increase the complexity quite a bit.
 *
 *   Interface::
 *      int dma_buf_mmap(struct dma_buf \*, struct vm_area_struct \*,
 *		       unsigned long);
 *
 *   If the importing subsystem simply provides a special-purpose mmap call to
 *   set up a mapping in userspace, calling do_mmap with dma_buf->file will
 *   equally achieve that for a dma-buf object.
