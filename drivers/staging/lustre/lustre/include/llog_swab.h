 * We assume all nodes are either little-endian or big-endian, and we
 * always send messages in the sender's native format.  The receiver
 * detects the message format by checking the 'magic' field of the message
 * (see lustre_msg_swabbed() below).
 *
 * Each type has corresponding 'lustre_swab_xxxtypexxx()' routines
 * are implemented in ptlrpc/pack_generic.c.  These 'swabbers' convert the
 * type from "other" endian, in-place in the message buffer.
 *
 * A swabber takes a single pointer argument.  The caller must already have
 * verified that the length of the message buffer >= sizeof (type).
 *
 * For variable length types, a second 'lustre_swab_v_xxxtypexxx()' routine
 * may be defined that swabs just the variable part, after the caller has
 * verified that the message buffer is large enough.
