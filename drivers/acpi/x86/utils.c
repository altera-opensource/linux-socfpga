/*
 * Some ACPI devices are hidden (status == 0x0) in recent BIOS-es because
 * some recent Windows drivers bind to one device but poke at multiple
 * devices at the same time, so the others get hidden.
 *
 * Some BIOS-es (temporarily) hide specific APCI devices to work around Windows
 * driver bugs. We use DMI matching to match known cases of this.
 *
 * We work around this by always reporting ACPI_STA_DEFAULT for these
 * devices. Note this MUST only be done for devices where this is safe.
 *
 * This forcing of devices to be present is limited to specific CPU (SoC)
 * models both to avoid potentially causing trouble on other models and
 * because some HIDs are re-used on different SoCs for completely
 * different devices.
