 * FUNCTION:    acpi_ds_build_internal_package_obj
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  walk_state      - Current walk state
 *              op              - Parser object to be translated
 *              element_count   - Number of elements in the package - this is
 *                                the num_elements argument to Package()
 *              obj_desc_ptr    - Where the ACPI internal object is returned
 *
 * RETURN:      Status
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Translate a parser Op package object to the equivalent
 *              namespace object
 *
 * NOTE: The number of elements in the package will be always be the num_elements
 * count, regardless of the number of elements in the package list. If
 * num_elements is smaller, only that many package list elements are used.
 * if num_elements is larger, the Package object is padded out with
 * objects of type Uninitialized (as per ACPI spec.)
 *
 * Even though the ASL compilers do not allow num_elements to be smaller
 * than the Package list length (for the fixed length package opcode), some
 * BIOS code modifies the AML on the fly to adjust the num_elements, and
 * this code compensates for that. This also provides compatibility with
 * other AML interpreters.
