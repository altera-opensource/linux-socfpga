 * struct klp_func - function structure for live patching

 * @new_func:	pointer to the patched function code
 * @old_sympos: a hint indicating which symbol position the old function
 *		can be found (optional)
 * @old_addr:	the address of the function being patched
 * @kobj:	kobject for sysfs resources
 * @stack_node:	list node for klp_ops func_stack list
 * @old_size:	size of the old function
 * @new_size:	size of the new function
 * @patched:	the func has been added to the klp_ops list
 * @transition:	the func is currently being applied or reverted
 *
 * The patched and transition variables define the func's patching state.  When
 * patching, a func is always in one of the following states:
 *
 *   patched=0 transition=0: unpatched
 *   patched=0 transition=1: unpatched, temporary starting state
 *   patched=1 transition=1: patched, may be visible to some tasks
 *   patched=1 transition=0: patched, visible to all tasks
 *
 * And when unpatching, it goes in the reverse order:
 *
 *   patched=1 transition=0: patched, visible to all tasks
 *   patched=1 transition=1: patched, may be visible to some tasks
 *   patched=0 transition=1: unpatched, temporary ending state
 *   patched=0 transition=0: unpatched
