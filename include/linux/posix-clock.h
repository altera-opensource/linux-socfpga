 * @clock_adjtime:  Adjust the clock
 * @clock_gettime:  Read the current time
 * @clock_getres:   Get the clock resolution
 * @clock_settime:  Set the current time value
 * @open:           Optional character device open method
 * @release:        Optional character device release method
 * @ioctl:          Optional character device ioctl method
