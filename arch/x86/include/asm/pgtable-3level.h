 * pte_offset_map_lock on 32bit PAE kernels was reading the pmd_t with
 * a "*pmdp" dereference done by gcc. Problem is, in certain places
 * where pte_offset_map_lock is called, concurrent page faults are
 * allowed, if the mmap_sem is hold for reading. An example is mincore
 * vs page faults vs MADV_DONTNEED. On the page fault side
 * pmd_populate rightfully does a set_64bit, but if we're reading the
 * pmd_t with a "*pmdp" on the mincore side, a SMP race can happen
 * because gcc will not read the 64bit of the pmd atomically. To fix
 * this all places running pmd_offset_map_lock() while holding the
 * mmap_sem in read mode, shall read the pmdp pointer using this
 * function to know if the pmd is null nor not, and in turn to know if
 * they can run pmd_offset_map_lock or pmd_trans_huge or other pmd
 * operations.
 *
 * Without THP if the mmap_sem is hold for reading, the pmd can only
 * transition from null to not null while pmd_read_atomic runs. So
 * we can always return atomic pmd values with this function.
 *
 * With THP if the mmap_sem is hold for reading, the pmd can become
 * trans_huge or none or point to a pte (and in turn become "stable")
 * at any time under pmd_read_atomic. We could read it really
 * atomically here with a atomic64_read for the THP enabled case (and
 * it would be a whole lot simpler), but to avoid using cmpxchg8b we
 * only return an atomic pmdval if the low part of the pmdval is later
 * found stable (i.e. pointing to a pte). And we're returning a none
 * pmdval if the low part of the pmd is none. In some cases the high
 * and low part of the pmdval returned may not be consistent if THP is
 * enabled (the low part may point to previously mapped hugepage,
 * while the high part may point to a more recently mapped hugepage),
 * but pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() only needs the low part
 * of the pmd to be read atomically to decide if the pmd is unstable
 * or not, with the only exception of when the low part of the pmd is
 * zero in which case we return a none pmd.

 * but that is not possible (without expensive cmpxchg8b) on PAE.  What
 * we do have is the guarantee that a PTE will only either go from not
 * present to present, or present to not present or both -- it will not
 * switch to a completely different present page without a TLB flush in
 * between; something that we are blocking by holding interrupts off.
 *
 * Setting ptes from not present to present goes:
 *
 *   ptep->pte_high = h;
 *   smp_wmb();
 *   ptep->pte_low = l;
 *
 * And present to not present goes:
 *
 *   ptep->pte_low = 0;
 *   smp_wmb();
 *   ptep->pte_high = 0;
 *
 * We must ensure here that the load of pte_low sees 'l' iff pte_high
 * sees 'h'. We load pte_high *after* loading pte_low, which ensures we
 * don't see an older value of pte_high.  *Then* we recheck pte_low,
 * which ensures that we haven't picked up a changed pte high. We might
 * have gotten rubbish values from pte_low and pte_high, but we are
 * guaranteed that pte_low will not have the present bit set *unless*
 * it is 'l'. Because get_user_pages_fast() only operates on present ptes
