Altera Interrupt Latency Counter soft IP
Altera Interrupt Latency Counter IP core driver provides a sysfs interface
for user to obtain interrupt latency values from Altera Interrupt Latency
Counter soft IP.

The sysfs interface is located at path,
/sys/bus/platform/devices/{addr}.ilc/ilc_data/{int_#}
with
- {addr}  = the base address of the soft ip
- {int_#} = the interrupt number

Example use case:
# cat /sys/bus/platform/devices/c0010000.ilc/ilc_data/40

Required properties:
- compatible :
  - "altr,ilc-1.0"
- reg :
  - physical base address of the soft ip and length of memory mapped region
- interrupt-parent :
  - interrupt source phandle similiar to the interrupt source node
- interrupts :
  -interrupt number. The interrupt specifier format depends on the interrupt
   controller parent

Altera specific properties:
- altr,sw-fifo-depth :
  - define software fifo depth needed to record latency values

Note:
- For edge triggered interrupt, the order of loading the ILC driver relative
 to driver of the actual interrupt source affects the meaning of the ILC
 values. If the ILC driver is loaded first, then the count values represent
 the time to the start of the interrupt handler of the of the interrupt source.
 If the order is switched, then the counts represent the time to finish the
 interrupt handler for the interrupt source.

- The driver for the interrupt source must be changed to request a shared irq.

Example:
	interrupt_latency_counter_0: intc@0x10000000 {
		compatible = "altr,ilc-1.0";
		reg = <0x10000000 0x00000100>;
		interrupt-parent = < &interrupt_parent >;
		interrupts = < 0 1 4 >;
		altr,sw-fifo-depth = < 32 >;
	};
