- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
  "avl_csr": Should contain the register configuration base address
  "avl_mem": Should contain the data base address
- #address-cells: Must be <1>.
- #size-cells: Must be <0>.
- flash device tree subnode, there must be a node with the following fields:
	- compatible: Should contain the flash name
	- #address-cells: please refer to /mtd/partition.txt
	- #size-cells: please refer to /mtd/partition.txt
	For partitions inside each flash, please refer to /mtd/partition.txt

Example:

			quadspi_controller_0: quadspi@0x180014a0 {
				compatible = "altr,quadspi-1.0";
				reg = <0x180014a0 0x00000020>,
				      <0x14000000 0x04000000>;
				reg-names = "avl_csr", "avl_mem";
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				flash0: epcq256@0 {
					compatible = "epcq256-nonjedec";
					#address-cells = <1>;
					#size-cells = <1>;
					partition@0 {
						/* 16 MB for raw data. */
						label = "EPCQ Flash 0 raw data";
						reg = <0x0 0x1000000>;
					};
					partition@1000000 {
						/* 16 MB for jffs2 data. */
						label = "EPCQ Flash 0 JFFS 2";
						reg = <0x1000000 0x1000000>;
					};
				};
