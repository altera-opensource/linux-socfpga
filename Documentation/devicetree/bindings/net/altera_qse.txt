* Altera Quad-Speed Ethernet MAC driver (QSE)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "altr,qse-msgdma-2.0" for MSGDMA with prefetcher based
		implementations.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
  the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
- interrupts: Should contain the QSE interrupts and it's mode.
- interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names
  "rx_irq":       DMA Rx dispatcher interrupt
  "tx_irq":       DMA Tx dispatcher interrupt
- rx-fifo-depth: MAC receive FIFO buffer depth in bytes
- tx-fifo-depth: MAC transmit FIFO buffer depth in bytes
- rx-fifo-almost-full: Value that indicates RX FIFO buffer is getting full
- rx-fifo-almost-empty: Value that indicates RX FIFO buffer is getting empty
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt in the same directory.
- sfp: See sff,sfp.txt in the same directory.
- dma-coherent: Present if DMA operations are coherent.

- altr,has-supplementary-unicast:
		If present, QSE supports additional unicast addresses.
		Otherwise additional unicast addresses are not supported.
- altr,has-ptp:
		If present, QSE supports 1588 timestamping.  Currently only
		supported with the msgdma prefetcher.
- altr,tx-pma-delay-ns:
		MAC Tx PMA digital delay in nanoseconds.
- altr,rx-pma-delay-ns:
		MAC RX PMA digital delay in nanoseconds.
- altr,tx-pma-delay-fns:
		MAX TX PMA digital delay in fractional nanoseconds.
- altr,rx-pma-delay-fns:
		MAX RX PMA digital delay in fractional nanoseconds.
- tx-poll-freq:
		Optional cycle count for Tx prefetcher to poll descriptor
		list.  If not present, defaults to 128, which at 125MHz is
		roughly 1usec.
- rx-poll-freq:
		Optional cycle count for Rx prefetcher to poll descriptor
		list.  If not present, defaults to 128, which at 125MHz is
		roughly 1usec.

Required registers by compatibility string:
- "altr,qse-msgdma-2.0"
	"control_port":		MAC configuration space region.
	"xcvr_ctrl":		PHY transceiver (XCVR) address space region.
	"tx_csr":		DMA Tx dispatcher control and status space region.
	"tx_pref":		DMA Tx prefetcher configuration space region.
	"rx_csr" :		DMA Rx dispatcher control and status space region.
	"rx_pref":		DMA Rx prefetcher configuration space region.
	"tod_ctrl":		Time of Day Control register only required when
				timestamping support is enabled.  Timestamping is
				only supported with the msgdma-2.0 implementation.
	"rx_fifo":		RX FIFO address space region.
	"phy_reconfig_csr":	PHY reconfiguration controller address space region.
	"chan_ready":		Channel ready address space region.

Optional properties:
- local-mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the same directory.
- max-frame-size: See ethernet.txt in the same directory.
