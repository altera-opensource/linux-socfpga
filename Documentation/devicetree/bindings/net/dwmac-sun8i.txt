* Allwinner sun8i GMAC ethernet controller

This device is a platform glue layer for stmmac.
Please see stmmac.txt for the other unchanged properties.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of the following string:
		"allwinner,sun8i-a83t-emac"
		"allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac"
		"allwinner,sun8i-v3s-emac"
		"allwinner,sun50i-a64-emac"
- reg: address and length of the register for the device.
- interrupts: interrupt for the device
- interrupt-names: must be "macirq"
- clocks: A phandle to the reference clock for this device
- clock-names: must be "stmmaceth"
- resets: A phandle to the reset control for this device
- reset-names: must be "stmmaceth"
- phy-mode: See ethernet.txt
- phy-handle: See ethernet.txt
- #address-cells: shall be 1
- #size-cells: shall be 0
- syscon: A phandle to the syscon of the SoC with one of the following
 compatible string:
  - allwinner,sun8i-h3-system-controller
  - allwinner,sun8i-v3s-system-controller
  - allwinner,sun50i-a64-system-controller
  - allwinner,sun8i-a83t-system-controller

Optional properties:
- allwinner,tx-delay-ps: TX clock delay chain value in ps. Range value is 0-700. Default is 0)
- allwinner,rx-delay-ps: RX clock delay chain value in ps. Range value is 0-3100. Default is 0)
Both delay properties need to be a multiple of 100. They control the delay for
external PHY.

Optional properties for the following compatibles:
  - "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac",
  - "allwinner,sun8i-v3s-emac":
- allwinner,leds-active-low: EPHY LEDs are active low

Required child node of emac:
- mdio bus node: should be named mdio with compatible "snps,dwmac-mdio"

Required properties of the mdio node:
- #address-cells: shall be 1
- #size-cells: shall be 0

The device node referenced by "phy" or "phy-handle" must be a child node
of the mdio node. See phy.txt for the generic PHY bindings.

The following compatibles require that the emac node have a mdio-mux child
node called "mdio-mux":
  - "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac"
  - "allwinner,sun8i-v3s-emac":
Required properties for the mdio-mux node:
  - compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-mdio-mux"
  - mdio-parent-bus: a phandle to EMAC mdio
  - one child mdio for the integrated mdio with the compatible
    "allwinner,sun8i-h3-mdio-internal"
  - one child mdio for the external mdio if present (V3s have none)
Required properties for the mdio-mux children node:
  - reg: 1 for internal MDIO bus, 2 for external MDIO bus

The following compatibles require a PHY node representing the integrated
PHY, under the integrated MDIO bus node if an mdio-mux node is used:
  - "allwinner,sun8i-h3-emac",
  - "allwinner,sun8i-v3s-emac":

Additional information regarding generic multiplexer properties can be found
at Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/mdio-mux.txt

Required properties of the integrated phy node:
- clocks: a phandle to the reference clock for the EPHY
- resets: a phandle to the reset control for the EPHY
- Must be a child of the integrated mdio
