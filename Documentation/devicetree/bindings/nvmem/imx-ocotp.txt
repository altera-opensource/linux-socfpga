Freescale i.MX6 On-Chip OTP Controller (OCOTP) device tree bindings

This binding represents the on-chip eFuse OTP controller found on
i.MX6Q/D, i.MX6DL/S, i.MX6SL, i.MX6SX and i.MX6UL SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of
	"fsl,imx6q-ocotp" (i.MX6Q/D/DL/S),
	"fsl,imx6sl-ocotp" (i.MX6SL), or
	"fsl,imx6sx-ocotp" (i.MX6SX),
	"fsl,imx6ul-ocotp" (i.MX6UL),
	"fsl,imx7d-ocotp" (i.MX7D/S),
	followed by "syscon".
- reg: Should contain the register base and length.
- clocks: Should contain a phandle pointing to the gated peripheral clock.

Optional properties:
- read-only: disable write access

Example:

	ocotp: ocotp@21bc000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx6q-ocotp", "syscon";
		reg = <0x021bc000 0x4000>;
		clocks = <&clks IMX6QDL_CLK_IIM>;
		read-only;
	};
