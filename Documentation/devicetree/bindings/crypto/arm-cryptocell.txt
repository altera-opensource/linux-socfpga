Arm TrustZone CryptoCell cryptographic engine

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "arm,cryptocell-712-ree".
- reg: Base physical address of the engine and length of memory mapped region.
- interrupts: Interrupt number for the device.

Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller that services
  interrupts for this device.
- clocks: Reference to the crypto engine clock.
- dma-coherent: Present if dma operations are coherent.

Examples:

       arm_cc712: crypto@80000000 {
               compatible = "arm,cryptocell-712-ree";
               interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
               interrupts = < 0 30 4 >;
               reg = < 0x80000000 0x10000 >;

       };
