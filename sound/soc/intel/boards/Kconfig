         Intel ASoC Machine Drivers. If you have a Intel machine that
         has an audio controller with a DSP and I2S or DMIC port, then
         enable this option by saying Y

         Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
         kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
         the questions about Intel ASoC machine drivers.
